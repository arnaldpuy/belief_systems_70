This study examines the origin, spread and empirical foundations of the belief that irrigation agriculture withdraws 70% of all 
freshwater available and produces 40% of all crops consumed worldwide.

### Data

This repository contains all the data and files produced in this study.

#### Primary data

The files below are required to replicate our study. Files named with "water" contain the 
original sample from Dimensions related to the 70% belief, while those with "food" pertain 
to the 40% belief. Those labelled with ''abstract'', ''policy'' or ''full.text'' include
references returned when the search queries were run in abstracts/keywords/title, in policy
documents only or against the full text. Files ending with ''_WORK.xlsx'' contain the list 
of all studies we surveyed searching for the targeted claim (including those returned
by Dimensions that did not actually contained the claim), whereas the files ending with 
''_NETWORK.xlsx'' contain the documents that have the claim or were cited as having the claim 
and hence are part of the belief network.

### Code

We offer the code in `.R`, `.pdf` and `.Rmd`. Our entire workflow can be run and the results replicated from either of these files.
The user must run the code from the same folder where the files in the primary data section are stored for a successful compilation.
