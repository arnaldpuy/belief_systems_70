freshwater available and produces 40% of all crops consumed worldwide.

## Abstract

In progress

## Replication

### Data

This repository contains all the data and files produced in this study.

### Code

We offer the code in `.R`, `.pdf` and `.rmd`. Our entire workflow can be run and the results replicated from either of these files.
The user must run the code from the same folder where the files are stored for a successful compilation.
